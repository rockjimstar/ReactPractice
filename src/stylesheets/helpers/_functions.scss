/*
*	Z-index
*	While technically this is just a pure function, but I felt it's worth being on the list as it's so easy to loose 
*	track of your z-index values when working in several different files, so we created this so that we could store them 
*	in one place for easy editing/recording. Just place this snippet in your main variables/settings.scss file (needs 
*	to be imported before any of your other files that reference a x-index of course).
